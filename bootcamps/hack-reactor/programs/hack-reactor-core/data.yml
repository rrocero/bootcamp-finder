reviews:
- HR helps with all aspects of the job search, from boosting your online profile and resume, to 1-on1 practice interview/whiteboarding sessions, reaching out to give you advice on each step of the way.
- To me, the most valuable trait of the program (if I had to choose) is the relentless emphasis on Learn By Doing. Every student undergoes a transformation from thinking "I don't know enough to do this" to "I know how to figure this out."
- I'm giving Hack Reactor 5 stars.  The 3 months I spent there have launched me into a more productive, high-paying, and satisfying job than I could have ever gotten otherwise.
